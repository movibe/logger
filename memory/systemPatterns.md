# System Patterns

## Design Patterns
1. Strategy Pattern
   - Used for implementing different logging strategies
   - Each logger implements a common interface
   - Easy to add new logging providers

2. Factory Pattern
   - Creates logger instances
   - Handles configuration and initialization

3. Observer Pattern
   - Event handling and propagation
   - Async event processing

4. Singleton Pattern
   - Single logger instance per application
   - Shared state management

## Code Organization
- src/
  - strategies/ (Different logging implementations)
  - interfaces/ (TypeScript interfaces)
  - utils/ (Helper functions)
  - types/ (TypeScript types)
  - constants/ (Shared constants)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each logger
- Integration tests for strategy combinations
- Performance benchmarks
- Type checking tests
